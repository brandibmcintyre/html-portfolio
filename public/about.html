<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently doing classwork in Web Development and loving every minute of it. Coding and learning new programming languages has become my passion and I look forward to using my new found skill set to contribute beauty and use into the world.</p>
<p>When I am not programming I am reading, playing with my son, hiking and thinking about better ways to craft the ultimate dessert.</p>
